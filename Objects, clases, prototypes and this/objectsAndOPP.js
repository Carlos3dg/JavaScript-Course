//How to enumarate object's properties
//for... in
//Like we have seen previously the for.. in enumarate the properties of an object.
//Consider the next object with some strings and one symbol as properties 
const SYM = Symbol();
console.log(SYM);
const o = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, [SYM]: 4};
//Here  the prop variable enumarate only the string properties of the o object 
for(let prop in o) {
    //Here the condition fails. It's says if the properties of hte o object are differents from the properties that the prop variable is enumarating, but due to this declaration fails the word continue is executed and follows with the code below the if statement 
    if(!o.hasOwnProperty(prop)) continue
    console.log(`${prop} : ${o[prop]}`);
} //a: 1 b: 2 c: 3
//Notice that for...in only enumarates the string properties and omit the symbol property.

//Object.keys
//Object.keys is a method to gets all the string properties of an object as an array 
console.log(Object.keys(o)); // ['a', 'b', 'c']

//We can get the same result shown by the for.. in loop with the object.keys method as follow:
Object.keys(o).forEach(prop => console.log(`${prop} : ${o[prop]}`)); //a: 1 b: 2 c: 3
//This kind of method is usefull when we need the key properties as an array, and in that way get access to all array methods
//example:
const ob = { apple: 1, xochilt: 2, ballon: 3, guitar: 4, xylophone: 5};
Object.keys(ob)
    .filter(prop => prop.match(/^x/))
    .forEach(prop => console.log(`${prop}: ${ob[prop]}`)); // xochilt: 2, xylophone: 5
//Here we get the key properties as an array and then we get all elements that start with 'x' using the filter method to finally print every element in our array with the forEach method

//Object-Oriented Programming
//Class and Instance Creation
//In the follow example we will make a class named Car and this one will have four properties two of them has default values, userGears as array and userGear as the first element of the userGears array, however this property can be modify in the shift method with the condition to be provided with an acceptable value (one equal to the userGears elements)
/*class Car {
    constructor(make, model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.userGears = ['P', 'N', 'R', 'D'];
        this.userGear = this.userGears[0];
    }

    shift(gear) {
        if(this.userGears.indexOf(gear) < 0)
            console.log(`Invalid gear: ${gear}`);
        this.userGear = gear;
    }


const car1 = new Car('Tesla', 'Model S');
car1.shift('D'); //We can change the userGear value to 'D' due to this value is part of the userGears elements
console.log(car1.userGear); // 'D'; 
car1.shift('O'); // Invalid gear: O //On the other hand we can not change the userGear value to 'O' due to this one doesn't exist in the userGears elements
//However we can change the value of this property directly event if this one is not in userGears elements
car1.userGear = 'O';
console.log(car1.userGear);  // O
*/
//Dynamic properties
//this can help mitigate this weakness. They have the semantics of a property with the functionality of a method.
class Carro {
    constructor(make, model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this._userGears = ['P', 'N', 'R', 'D'];
        this._userGear = this._userGears[0];
    }

    get userGear() {
        return this._userGear;
    }

    set userGear(value) {
        if(this._userGears.indexOf(value) < 0)
            console.log(`Invalid gear: ${value}`);
        this._userGear = value;
    }

    shift(gear) {
        this.userGear = gear;
    }
}
//However this doesn't solve the problem
const carro1 = new Carro('Tesla', 'Model S');
carro1.shift('D');
console.log(carro1._userGear); // D
carro1._userGear = 'O'
console.log(carro1._userGear); // O
//One way to resolve this is using an instance of WeakMap, to see more about this topic go to page 152 on Learning javascript book

//STATIC METHODS(OR CLASS METHODS)
//This kind of methods are not bound to an specific instance instead they are bound to the class itself
//Like the instance methods perform task related to the instance objects, static methods perform generic tasks related to the class
//We're going to see an examÂ´ple of static method apply to the VIN(Vehicle Identification Numbers) cars, like the car object is able to run and change gears(cambios), this object is not able to assignt itself a VIN, however this concept is related to the cars in general we could use it like static method 
//Also static methods are often used to operate in multiple instance objects, like in this example: areSimilar() and areSame()
class Vehicle {
    //Satic method to generate the VIN car
    static getNextVin() {
        return Vehicle.nextVin++;
    }

    constructor(make, model) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.vin = Vehicle.getNextVin(); //Here we could use this, however due to is referring to a static method we put the name Class
    }
    //Satic method that operate with multiple objects
    static areSimilar(car1, car2) {
        return console.log(car1.make===car2.make && car1.model===car2.model);
    }
    //Static method that operate with multiple objects
    static areSame(car1, car2) {
        return console.log(car1.vin===car2.vin);
    }
}
//A property declare outside the class with a default value
Vehicle.nextVin = 0;

const auto1 = new Vehicle('Tesla', 'S');
const auto2 = new Vehicle('Mazda', '3');
const auto3 = new Vehicle('Mazda', '3');

console.log(auto1.vin); //1
console.log(auto2.vin); //2
console.log(auto3.vin);// 3

Vehicle.areSimilar(auto1, auto2); //False
Vehicle.areSimilar(auto2, auto3); //true
Vehicle.areSame(auto2, auto3); // false
Vehicle.areSame(auto2, auto2); //true

//INHERITANCE
/*Taking the Vehicle example above, if we wanted a Vehicle class for differents kind of vehicles like an airplane, a car or a boat, Then we needed a father class of all this kind of classes.
Inheritance is used to create methods that are bound to different kind of objects with a different class, we could create a Car class method called airbag, so this method is going to be used just in the objects instance of Car class, but if we have other class to boats objects and we need to count the passengers gettting into it we could create a method in a generic class, in this case Vehicle class, so in this way if the boat and the car class are inherited from the Vehicle class, these could use the method to count the passegers inside them */

class Vehicles {
    constructor() {
        this.passengers = [];
        console.log('Vehicle created');

    addPassenger(p) {
